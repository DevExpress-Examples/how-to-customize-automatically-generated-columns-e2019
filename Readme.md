# How to customize automatically generated columns


<p>The following example shows how to customize automatically generated columns.</p><p>In this example, the ColumnsPopulated event is handled to hide the 'ID' column, and specify the sorting order of the first visible column.</p><p>Starting with version 2013 vol 1 the <strong>GridControl.ColumnsPopulated</strong> event is marked as obsolete. The <strong>GridControl.AutoGeneratedColumns</strong> event should be used instead. Moreover, in 13.1, this example includes two ways for setting templates in code-behind.</p>
